## Reading Session #1: AlexNet
Friday 24/12/2021 and 31/12/2021 were dedicated to read [ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2012/file/c399862d3b9d6b76c8436e924a68c45b-Paper.pdf) article. 
The files concerning these sessions are in ```./AlexNet```.

AlexNet is the first large CNN that achieved a state-of-the-art accuracy in 2012 on the large dataset "ImageNet". 
During this session, we went over: 
* [How to create a simple MLP and train it on the MNIST dataset](https://github.com/IHIaadj/reading_sessions/blob/main/AlexNet/MNIST%20Simple%20Neural%20network.ipynb)
* [Create a CNN to avoid overfitting MLPs on large dataset](https://github.com/IHIaadj/reading_sessions/blob/main/AlexNet/CNN%20Simple.ipynb)
* [Use a pretrained Alexnet on an image](https://github.com/IHIaadj/reading_sessions/blob/main/AlexNet/Pretrained%20Alexnet.ipynb)
* [Summary of the paper](https://github.com/IHIaadj/reading_sessions/blob/main/AlexNet/summary.pdf)
## Reading session #2 : Spiking neural networks 
we have read [Survey of Purpose of Hardware Implementation of Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/2005/2005.01467.pdf).

The files concerning these sessions are in ```./SNN``` .
* [spiking CNN with 98% accuracy on mnist using spikingjelly - Amine Ziad Ounnoughene](https://github.com/IHIaadj/reading_sessions/blob/main/SNN/spiking-cnn-amine-ziad.ipynb)
